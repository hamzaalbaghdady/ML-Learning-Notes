A) Conceptual (10 questions)

What is the difference between .loc[] and .iloc[]?
Answer: iloc deals with columns as indexes while loc deal with them as names which make it easier to work with.

Why is chained indexing dangerous? Example?
Answer: I haven't crossed that in kaggel tutorial, so I have no idea.

Explain the difference between groupby().agg() and groupby().apply().
Answer: agg preforms one or more of aggrgation functions like mean, max, sum, etc,. apply does preform a spesific function or lambda exprission on data.

How does Pandas handle missing values in numerical vs object columns?
Answer: we can use some of the puilt-in functions like replace, and fillna, or make our logic to fill missing values with what we see is the best fit.

What’s the difference between merge, join, and concat?
Answer: I havent studied merge, join lets you combine different DataFrame objects which have an index in common, while concat is combine different DataFrames and/or Series in non-trivial ways.

What is a MultiIndex and when does it appear unexpectedly?
Answer: is when we preform groupby

When should you use pivot_table instead of groupby?
Answer: I have no idea.

How do you detect and remove outliers? Mention 3 techniques.
Answre: 1 user standerd devation to detect them
2 use min and max
3 i have no clue

Why is inplace=True often discouraged?
Answer: Because it change the real datafram not just make a copy of it.

What happens when you sort a DataFrame with na_position='first'?
Answer: I have no idea.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B) Practical Coding (10 questions)

Write Pandas code to:

Slice every 7th row from a DataFrame.
df.loc[:,:,7]

Replace all negative values in a numeric column with zero.
df.loc[df.column <0].column=0

Count how many times each city appears in a column.
df.city.value_counts()

Find the top 3 categories by average price.
df.groupby('category')category.mean.sort_values(by='category',ascending=False)

Extract rows where a text column contains two specific keywords.
I have no idea how to extract rows.
Create a new column equal to log(price + 1).
df['new_column']=log(df.price+1)

Normalize all numeric columns into range [0,1].
df.map(Lambda x:x if x.dtype!= object x= range(0,1))
Drop duplicate rows based on two columns only.
I have no idea how to drop rows.
Convert a “timestamp” column into day, month, year columns.
df.['day','month','year']=df.timestamp.somefunction()
Fill missing values differently based on column type (mean for numeric, mode for object).
df.fillna()

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

C) Debugging (5 questions)

You must fix these.

df[df['A'] > 5]['B'] = 10
df.loc[(df['A'] >5)& (['B']==10)]

df.groupby('category')['price'].apply(lambda x: x.mean)
df.groupby('category')['price'].apply(lambda x: x.mean())

df.iloc[df['age'] > 30]
df.loc[df.age>30]

df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df.date, format='%Y/%d/%m')
No idea
df.merge(df2, how='inner', on=['id1','id2','id3'])
…but the columns in df2 are lowercase.
no idea

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You see a column with mean = 20 and std = 200. What does that tell you?
That tells me that we have too many outliers and data need cleaning or otherwise it cant be worked with.

A column has 97% zeros and 3% non-zero values. What ML issue appears?
We can not use it because it alwayes will be zero.

Your merge operation explodes rows from 10k → 50k. Why?
No idea.
You see NaN appearing after a groupby operation. Why?
There more than one value with NaN.

You have a category with only 2 samples in the entire dataset. What do you do?
convert it to numbers
